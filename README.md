Vanilla JS Movie seat booking system using localStorage

## Motivation

I wanted to create a real cinema feel on the desktop, using perspective and gradients to create the feel of looking down at the cinema screen from above.

This was also a chance for me to use localStorage to hold onto the selected seat data in the user's browser to ensure it was there should they refresh or come back to the page.

## Tech used
HTML, CSS and JavaScript. No frameworks were harmed in the making of this project.

## Features
The main feature, which is only visible on larger screens, is the movie screen which shows gifs of the movie which has been selected. This is easily updatable by adding to the JSON object in the JavaScript file.

## Credits
I got inspired to build this after seeing [Brad Traversy's Movie Seat Booking from his Vanilla Web Projects](https://github.com/bradtraversy/vanillawebprojects/tree/master/movie-seat-booking), so I've been heavily influenced by that.

I looked at his code, recreated it exactly, wrote down the project specifications, and then created this mock booking system from scratch based solely on those project specifications. Any other similarities are purely coincidental.
